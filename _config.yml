          Designed and developed a cloud-based Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) service that leverages 
          blockchain technology to provide a high level of security assurance. Using smart contract functionalities 
          on the Ethereum blockchain. I implemented ABAC state changes to ensure that all access control changes 
          are tamper-proof and transparently recorded on the blockchain. In addition, I developed a protocol that enables 
          real-time verification of data updates on the blockchain by enterprise applications, allowing for transparency 
          and ensuring that access control changes made by users are legitimate.

          To test the functionality and efficiency of the system, I created a prototype using the Rinkeby Ethereum test network 
          and Amazon Web Services. This experience allowed me to gain a deep understanding of blockchain technology and its practical 
          applications in providing secure access control solutions.

          Created Meet@Hobby, a full-stack web application that facilitates connections between individuals who share 
          common interests. The app includes features such as group formation, event organization, and real-time chat.
          Implemented the application using the Django framework and utilized technologies such as Python, MySQL, and HTML 
          to build the robust backend. 
          
          Additionally, I also developed an Android version of the app using Java and SQLite that mirrors the web version's 
          functionalities, thus providing a seamless user experience across platforms.

           A tool designed to simplify and accelerate migration to Azure.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I played a key role in developing and launching the SQL features for Azure Migrate. I took ownership 
          of Azure Migrate's SQL agent, which tracks the migration of SQL servers from on-premises servers to Azure, 
          and ensured a successful transition from Public Preview to GA. My responsibilities included creating the 
          End-to-End Test project for the Azure Migrate SQL Agent, designing and writing test cases covering all major 
          scenarios, and restructuring the SQL Agent codebase to make it more mockable and writing unit tests. 
          This helped identify and resolve issues early on in the development process, leading to a more stable and 
          reliable product.

          I also separated the codebase for SQL Agent from Azure Migrate codebase, converted it from .Net Framework to .Net 6,
          and implemented support for Named Pipe and Fallback features. In addition, I was on Primary on-call and DRI for Azure 
          Migrate SQL, attending customer calls to understand and solve their problems.

          Overall, my contributions has been instrumental in the successful launch of the SQL feature for Azure Migrate. This 
          experience gave me a deep understanding of customer needs and helped me develop strong communication and problem-solving skills.

          An open-source design system from Microsoft that enables developers to create consistent and accessible user interfaces across 
          platforms.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I had the opportunity to work on the development of FluentUI Android, which is an open-source design library that provides an 
          OfficeUI experience. During my tenure, I implemented important missing features such as button widgets, Topsheet behavior 
          with and without persistent options, Sidesheet behavior, top and side dialogs, TabBar layout, and anchor view support in sheets.
          To aid in the adoption and usage of these widgets, I created corresponding demos for each widget implemented. These demos helped 
          showcase various use cases and made it easier for other developers to integrate them into their applications.

          Additionally, I worked on the initial setup of Token Pipeline for FluentUI Android, which served as the base for Stardust merger 
          of FluentUI library across all platforms. This helped reduce tasks for developers and made my widgets work via Token pipeline. 
          My contributions to the project helped make it more comprehensive and user-friendly.
