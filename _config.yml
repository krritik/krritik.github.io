          Developed a cloud service for Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with security guarantee provided through the use of blockchain, specifically Ethereum. Implemented ABAC state changes using smart contract functionalities on the blockchain, ensuring a tamper-proof record of access control changes.
          Designed a protocol that allowed enterprise application to verify whether data updated in the blockchain is same as those done by its users or not in real-time, providing real-time verification and transparency to access control changes.
          Developed a prototype system using the Rinkeby Ethereum test network and Amazon Web Services to test and verify the functionality and efficiency of the system

          Contributed and took ownership of Azure Migrateâ€™s SQL agent, which tracks the migration of SQL servers from on-premises servers running on VMWare and Hyper-V to Azure. Played a key role in the successful transition of the SQL feature for Azure Migrate from Public Preview to GA.
          Created the End-to-End Test project for the Azure Migrate SQL Agent from scratch. Designed and wrote test cases covering all the major scenarios and deployed them to CloudTest, ensuring comprehensive testing of the SQL agent.
          Separated the codebase for SQL Agent from Azure Migrate codebase and refactored and converted the SQL Agent codebase from .Net Framework to .Net 6.
          Implemented support for Named Pipe and Fallback features, which increased the funnel for SQL Server deep discovery and helped to ensure seamless migration to Azure.
